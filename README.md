## Introduction

Weather forecasting is the use of science and technology to forecast atmospheric conditions for a certain place and period.

**Types of Weather Forecasting**

Short Range Forecasting | Medium Range Forecasting | Long-Range Forecasts

**Weather Forecasting Process**

A weather forecast is made up of three steps: Observation and Analysis of Precipitation and Temperature change of Indian weather in 2023 with the help of previous year data from 2008 to 2022. To determine the state of the atmosphere in the future, and estimation of specific variables. One method of qualitative extrapolation is to conclude the weather features will continue to travel in the same direction as they have been.

> **Observation and Analysis**

1. While data-access policies differ by country, all of these reports are sent to regional and global centers through the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Global Telecommunications System (GTS).

2. The data is then compiled, redistributed in the GTS, and used in various numerical forecasting models. Typically, these numerical models begin with data collected between the hours of 0000 and 1200 UTC (7 A.M. and 7 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, respectively).

3. To aid the forecaster, the data is printed, mapped, and graphed in several ways. Furthermore, some "initialization" routines slightly change the data when it enters a prediction model only for that model.

## Precipitation :

Precipitation is water that falls back to the surface of the earth upon condensing in the atmosphere. In other words, any form of water which falls, whether it is in liquid or frozen form, falls as precipitation only. Now that we are clear on what is precipitation, let us move on to the different types. You can consider heavy or light rain as precipitation and even snow, drizzle, and hail.

Types of Precipitation : 

Precipitation plays a major part in the water cycle as it is the one that brings in the deposit of freshwater on the planet. It can be divided into three categories depending upon the form such as:

- Liquid water
- Ice
- Liquid water freezes when comes in contact with the surface

## Temperature :

Temperature, measure of hotness or coldness expressed in terms of any of several arbitrary scales and indicating the direction in which heat energy will spontaneously flow i.e., from a hotter body (one at a higher temperature) to a colder body (one at a lower temperature).

Three temperature scales are in general use today. 

- The Fahrenheit (°F) temperature scale is used in the United States and a few other English-speaking countries. 
- The Celsius (°C) temperature scale is standard in virtually all countries that have adopted the metric system of measurement, and it is widely used in the sciences. 
- The Kelvin (K) scale, an absolute temperature scale (obtained by shifting the Celsius scale by −273.15° so that absolute zero coincides with 0 K), is recognized as the international standard for scientific temperature measurement.
