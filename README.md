## Introduction

Weather forecasting is the use of science and technology to forecast atmospheric conditions for a certain place and period.

**Types of Weather Forecasting**

Short Range Forecasting | Medium Range Forecasting | Long-Range Forecasts

**Weather Forecasting Process**

A weather forecast is made up of three steps: observation and analysis, extrapolation to determine the state of the atmosphere in the future, and estimation of specific variables. One method of qualitative extrapolation is to conclude the weather features will continue to travel in the same direction as they have been.

> **Observation and Analysis**

1. While data-access policies differ by country, all of these reports are sent to regional and global centers through the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Global Telecommunications System (GTS).

2. The data is then compiled, redistributed in the GTS, and used in various numerical forecasting models. Typically, these numerical models begin with data collected between the hours of 0000 and 1200 UTC (7 A.M. and 7 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, respectively).

3. To aid the forecaster, the data is printed, mapped, and graphed in several ways. Furthermore, some "initialization" routines slightly change the data when it enters a prediction model only for that model.
